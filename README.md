 Implement a calculator. The calculator can perform Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division on 2 Integers and returns an Integer. In the logic you can only use the '+' plus operator and a constant with value of -1, 0, 1. Division will return only the smallest whole number (e.g. 14/5 = 2) Hint: create a FlipSign method that will return the negative of a number (e.g. FlipSign(4) returns -4)
